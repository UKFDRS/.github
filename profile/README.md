The GitHub organization for the UK Fire Danger Rating System.

**For full details, please visit the [official website](https://ukfdrs.com)**

This project is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) (https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/), grant reference [NE/T003553/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE%2FT003553%2F1).

## [About](https://www.ukfdrs.com)

The UKFDRS is a research project seeking to establish and test the key components necessary to build a UK fire danger rating systems. The core objectives of this work are:

- Produce UK fuel maps at the national landscape level
- Assess the moisture regimes in key fuel types across the UK
- Determine flammability, energy content, and ignitability of UK fuels to establish UK fuel models
- Determine the ranges of UK fire behaviour for key fuel types
- Identify impact hotspots and model exemplar fire events with consideration of assets and communities at risk.
- Incorporate stakeholder knowledge and resources

The outlined work is broken down into 6 work packages. Not all are represented in this organizations repositories

## Repositories

The repositories under this organization primarily contain the code developed as part of this research. These repositories are not proportional to the work packages outlined, and represent a small portion of the research undertaken in this project. Please consult the [Publications](https://ukfdrs.com/publications/) page for a more complete collection of work.

These repositories serve to fulfil the [open access policy](https://www.ukri.org/about-us/policies-standards-and-data/good-research-resource-hub/open-research/) of the UKRI, by providing free access to the public.  
Please be aware that some repositories may not be shown, and are set to private until the project is complete and the work published.

Consult the individual README's of each repository for a complete description. In general, the code is structured to be easy to use by anyone, with detailed instruction contained within each repository's wiki.  
Most of the data used in this project is publicly available, and details will be given on how to obtain the datasets. These datasets are not hosted in the repositories, as the files are very large.  
Where possible, sample data may be included to serve for demonstration purposes
